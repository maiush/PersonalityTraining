# Open Character Training: SHAPING THE PERSONA OF AI ASSISTANTS THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL AI

## Overview

The character of the *AI assistant* persona generated by modern chatbot large language models, from its surface-level behavior to its apparent values, beliefs, and ethics, has an effect on interaction quality, perceived intelligence, and alignment with both developer and user intentions. The shaping of this persona, known as **Character Training**, is a critical component of industry post-training, yet remains effectively unstudied in the academic literature. We introduce the first open implementation of character training, leveraging Constitutional AI and synthetic introspective data to shape the assistant persona in a more effective and controlled manner than alternatives such as constraining system prompts or activation steering. Specifically, we fine-tune three popular open-weights models using 11 example personas, such as humorous, deeply caring, or even malevolent. With our methods, the expression of these personas is more robust to adversarial prompting than the above two alternatives, while also leading to more coherent and realistic generations. Additionally, we demonstrate this fine-tuning has little to no effect on general capabilities as measured by common benchmarks. 
Finally, we also introduce a new method to track changes in character by analyzing the revealed preferences of the assistant, uncovering a clear and holistic change induced by our approach.
